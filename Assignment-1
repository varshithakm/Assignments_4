Q-01

 A common usecase for using a daemon set instead of a replicaset is when you want to ensure that a specific pod is running on every node in a cluster.

 Replication controller not in control of allocating all pods to all nodes which will randomly taken and distributes
 but it can also distribute all of them to the same node which is not a welcoming condition for config manages they 
 need their application to run in each and every machines which is the reason we have daemonset.
 BENEFITS OF DAEMON SET :-
  BENEFITS OF DAEMON SET :-
 It will allocates exactly one pod where node.
