Deleting the vote pod
kubectl delete po vote-84849dc97-9cpvv
pod "vote-84849dc97-9cpvv" deleted
*When we delete the vote pod there are no changes in the front end as well as in the unix.

Deleting the worker pod 
kubectl delete po worker-dd46d7584-h9b5b
pod "worker-dd46d7584-h9b5b" deleted
* When we delete the worker pod there are no changes in the front end as well as in the unix.

Deleting the db pod 
kubectl delete po db-b54cd94f4-4hrnk
pod "db-b54cd94f4-4hrnk" deleted

When we delete the db pod there are no changes in the front end as well as in the unix but ideally there should be some difference but instead the result 
pod and worker pod restarts .
